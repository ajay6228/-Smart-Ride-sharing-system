Project Overview
The Smart Ride-Sharing System is a Java-based application designed to connect passengers with drivers efficiently while optimizing ride allocation, cost estimation, and real-time tracking. This system enhances traditional ride-hailing services by incorporating intelligent features such as route optimization, dynamic pricing, and user feedback mechanisms.

Key Features
1. User Management
Passengers and drivers can register and log in.

Each user has a profile with details such as name, contact, and ride history.

2. Ride Request & Matching
Passengers can request a ride by providing pickup and drop-off locations.

The system intelligently matches passengers with the nearest available drivers.

Supports carpooling by grouping users with similar routes to reduce costs.

3. Dynamic Fare Calculation
Implements a smart pricing algorithm based on factors like distance, traffic conditions, and demand surge.

Users receive a fare estimate before confirming a ride.

4. Real-Time Tracking & Navigation
Tracks drivers and passengers using simulated GPS coordinates.

Uses Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm or A Search Algorithm* for optimal route selection.

5. Payment & Wallet System
Users can pay via in-app wallets, credit/debit cards, or digital payment methods.

Automatic fare deduction from the user's wallet upon ride completion.

6. Ratings & Reviews
Passengers and drivers can rate each other after ride completion.

The system maintains a reputation score to improve service quality.

7. Admin Dashboard
Manages users, drivers, ride history, and system analytics.

Monitors demand patterns and ride distribution.

Technologies Used
Java (Core & OOP Concepts) â€“ Main development language.

JavaFX or Spring Boot â€“ For GUI or web-based administration.

MySQL / PostgreSQL â€“ Database for user and ride management.

Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap â€“ For route and location services.

Multithreading â€“ To handle multiple ride requests simultaneously.

Expected Outcome
The Smart Ride-Sharing System provides a seamless and optimized ride-hailing experience, reducing passenger wait times and maximizing driver efficiency. The inclusion of real-time tracking, intelligent ride matching, and dynamic pricing makes this system more adaptable to urban mobility needs.
